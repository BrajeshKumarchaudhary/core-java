## Arrays
```text
  -An array is collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 
  -The idea is to store multiple items of same type together.
  -This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value
  -the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
  -Arrays allow random access of elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
