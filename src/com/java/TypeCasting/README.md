## Type Casting in java
```text
    /*
     *When you assign value of one data type to another, the two types might not be compatible with each other.
     *Two Type of Type casting in java
     *a.Widening or Automatic Type Conversion or Implicit
     *b.Narrowing or Explicit Conversion
     */
 //Widening or Automatic Type Conversion or Implicit
    /*
     *The two data types are compatible.
     *When we assign value of a smaller data type to a bigger data type.
     *Byte->Short->Int->Long->Float->Double
     */

 //Narrowing or Explicit Conversion
    /*
     *If we want to assign a value of larger data type to a smaller data type we perform explicit type casting or narrowing.
     *This is useful for incompatible data types where automatic conversion cannot be done.
     *Double->Float->Long->Int->Short->Byte
     */
