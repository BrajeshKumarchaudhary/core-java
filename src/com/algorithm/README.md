## Algorithm
```text
   -Set of rules to be followed to solve problems
   -Therefore Algorithm refers to a set of rules/instructions that step-by-step define how a work is to be executed upon in order to get the expected results.
   -Input->Algorithm(Set of rules)->Output
   -Characteristics of an algorithm
     a.Well-defined Inputs
     b.Well-defined Outputs
     c.Clear and Unambiguous
     d.Finite-ness
     e.Feasible
     f.Language Independent
    
  a.Well-Defined Inputs: If an algorithm says to take inputs, it should be well-defined inputs.
  b.Well-Defined Outputs: The algorithm must clearly define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined as well.
  c.Clear and Unambiguous: Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning.  
  d.Finite-ness: The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should not end up in an infinite loops or similar
  e.Feasible: The algorithm must be simple, generic and practical, such that it can be executed upon will the available resources. It must not contain some future technology, or anything
  f.Language Independent: The Algorithm designed must be language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be same, as expected.
