## SOLID 
```text
S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD)** principles** by Robert C.
These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

S.O.L.I.D stands for:

S - Single-responsiblity principle
O - Open-closed principle
L - Liskov substitution principle
I - Interface segregation principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

```

## Single-responsibility Principle
```text
S.R.P for short - this principle states that:

"A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job."

```

## Open-closed Principle

```text
  "Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

```

## Liskov substitution principle

```text
"if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program."

```



## Interface segregation principle

```text

"A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use."

```

## Dependency Inversion principle

```text
"The principle of Dependency Inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions."
